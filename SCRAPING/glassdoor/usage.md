I've completed the remainder of the enhanced_glassdoor_scraper.py file. The missing section included:
Command-line argument parsing:

Authentication arguments (email/password with environment variable defaults)
Search parameters (keywords, location, max results)
Filter options (job type, salary, rating, experience level, remote)
Enrichment option (to fetch full details for top N jobs)
Output configuration (filename and format: JSON/CSV)
Display options (headless mode toggle)

Main execution logic:

Initialize the scraper with credentials
Optional login step
Execute job search with all filters
Optional enrichment of top jobs with full details
Save results to file
Print summary statistics
Error handling and graceful shutdown

The script can now be run from the command line with various options, for example:
bash

python enhanced_glassdoor_scraper.py -k "data scientist" -l "London" -m 50 --remote --rating-min 4.0I've completed the remainder of the enhanced_glassdoor_scraper.py file. The missing section included:
