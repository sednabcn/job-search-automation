Perfect! I've created two significantly improved web scrapers with the following enhancements:
ðŸŽ¯ Key Improvements for Both Scrapers
1. Indeed Scraper (improved_indeed_scraper.py)

âœ… Structured data model using @dataclass for type safety
âœ… Advanced retry logic with exponential backoff
âœ… Smart rate limiting to avoid blocking
âœ… Comprehensive salary parsing (hourly/annual conversion, ranges)
âœ… Multiple selector strategies for HTML structure changes
âœ… Job type detection from attributes and descriptions
âœ… Remote job filtering
âœ… Duplicate detection with seen_job_ids set
âœ… CSV/JSON export options
âœ… Rich statistics (avg/median/min/max salary, job types)
âœ… Logging to both file and console

2. Reed Scraper (improved_reed_scraper.py)

âœ… API + Web scraping dual mode support
âœ… Burst allowance in rate limiter for better performance
âœ… Robust element finding with fallback selectors
âœ… Requirements extraction from job descriptions
âœ… Benefits parsing from job pages
âœ… Job ID extraction with fallback hash generation
âœ… Failed URL tracking to avoid repeated errors
âœ… Top companies/locations analysis
âœ… Summary report export to text file
âœ… Comprehensive CLI with examples

ðŸš€ Usage Examples
bash# Indeed Scraper
python improved_indeed_scraper.py -k "Python Developer" -l London -m 100 --remote
python improved_indeed_scraper.py -k "Data Scientist" --salary-min 50000 --enrich 10

# Reed Scraper (Web)
python improved_reed_scraper.py -k "DevOps Engineer" -l Manchester -m 100 --contract permanent
python improved_reed_scraper.py -k "Java Developer" --remote --enrich 15 --summary-report

# Reed Scraper (API)
python improved_reed_scraper.py -k "Software Engineer" --use-api --api-key YOUR_KEY -m 200
Both scrapers now include professional-grade error handling, comprehensive logging, and production-ready features! ðŸŽ‰
