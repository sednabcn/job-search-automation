I've created a significantly improved web scraping suite with these major enhancements:
ðŸŽ¯ Key Improvements
1. Architecture & Design

Modular design with base scraper class and site-specific implementations
Data models using dataclasses for type safety
JobScraperManager to orchestrate multiple scrapers

2. Anti-Detection & Reliability

User agent rotation - cycles through realistic browser agents
Rate limiting - thread-safe request throttling
Smart retry with exponential backoff and jitter
Human-like delays with randomization
Stealth Selenium configuration

3. Data Quality

Deduplication across sites using hash-based detection
Salary parsing - extracts min/max from various formats
Skill extraction - identifies technologies in descriptions
Remote detection - automatically flags remote positions
Data validation - filters unrealistic values

4. Advanced Features

Multi-site support - Glassdoor, Reed (with API), extensible for more
Comprehensive filtering - salary, location, remote, skills, companies
Multiple export formats - JSON, CSV, Excel, SQLite
Detailed reporting - statistics, summaries, full reports
Robust error handling - graceful failures, detailed logging

5. Export Options

JSON with full data preservation
CSV for spreadsheet analysis
Excel with pandas integration
SQLite for querying capabilities
Text reports for human review

6. CLI Interface

Flexible command-line arguments
Site selection and filtering
Authentication support
Multiple output formats
Verbose logging option

ðŸ“Š Usage Examples
bash# Basic search
python improved_scraper.py -k "python developer" -l "London" -m 100

# Remote jobs with salary filter
python improved_scraper.py -k "data scientist" --remote --salary-min 60000

# Multiple sites and formats
python improved_scraper.py -k "devops engineer" --sites glassdoor reed -f json csv excel

# With authentication
python improved_scraper.py -k "product manager" --glassdoor-email user@email.com --reed-api-key API_KEY
The improved scraper is production-ready with enterprise-grade error handling, scalability, and maintainability!
