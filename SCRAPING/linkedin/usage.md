I've created an enhanced LinkedIn job scraper with the following improvements:
Key Features:
1. Public Job Search (No Auth Required)

Uses LinkedIn's guest API to search public job listings
Supports keyword and location-based searches
Advanced filters: remote jobs, job type, experience level

2. Detailed Job Scraping

Extracts comprehensive job details from individual listings
Captures: title, company, location, description, employment type, seniority, skills, applicant count

3. Multiple Scraping Modes

Search mode: Search LinkedIn with filters
URL mode: Scrape specific job URLs or from a file

4. Smart Features

Automatic deduplication by job ID
Append mode to add to existing data
Respectful rate limiting (customizable delay)
Progress tracking and error handling
JSON output for easy integration

Usage Examples:
bash# Search for data science jobs
python linkedin_job_scraper.py --keywords "data scientist" --location "New York, NY"

# Search for remote jobs with filters
python linkedin_job_scraper.py --keywords "software engineer" --remote --max-results 50

# Full-time mid-senior positions
python linkedin_job_scraper.py --keywords "product manager" --experience-level 4 --job-type F

# Scrape specific job URL
python linkedin_job_scraper.py --mode urls --url "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/123456789"

# Scrape from file of URLs
python linkedin_job_scraper.py --mode urls --urls my_saved_jobs.txt

# Append to existing file
python linkedin_job_scraper.py --keywords "data analyst" --append --output jobs.json
Filter Options:

Job Type: F (Full-time), P (Part-time), C (Contract), T (Temporary), I (Internship)
Experience Level: 1-6 (Internship to Executive)
Remote: --remote flag

The scraper is respectful with built-in delays and uses public endpoints, so no authentication is needed!
