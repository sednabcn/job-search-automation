# Job Search Automation System - Technical Summary

## Overview
Developed a multi-platform job search automation system that aggregates 
opportunities from LinkedIn, Indeed, Reed, and Glassdoor, with intelligent 
filtering and application tracking.

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Components:
- **Python 3.11** - Core automation scripts
- **GitHub Actions** - Scheduled workflow orchestration (every 6 hours)
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup4, Selenium
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, JSON manipulation
- **API Integration**: Platform-specific APIs (LinkedIn, Indeed)

### Key Features Implemented:
1. **Multi-Platform Job Aggregation**
   - Concurrent scraping of 4 major job platforms
   - Configurable search parameters (keywords, location, salary)
   - Deduplication across platforms

2. **Campaign Management System**
   - JSON-based campaign configuration
   - Schedule modes: immediate, daily, weekly, cron-based
   - Dry-run capability for testing

3. **Data Pipeline**
   - ETL process: Extract jobs → Transform/filter → Load to tracking DB
   - JSON data storage with version control
   - Automated backup and archival system

4. **Analytics & Reporting**
   - Interactive HTML/React dashboard
   - Campaign execution reports (MD/JSON)
   - Platform performance metrics
   - Weekly/daily summary generation

5. **Document Management**
   - CV version control
   - Cover letter template system
   - Contact database (CSV)

### Infrastructure:
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows
- **Version Control**: Git with automated commits
- **Storage**: File-based (JSON, CSV) with structured directories
- **Notifications**: Email integration via SMTP

### Code Organization:
