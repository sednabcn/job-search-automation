# Job Search Automation System - Technical Summary

## Overview
Developed a multi-platform job search automation system that aggregates 
opportunities from LinkedIn, Indeed, Reed, and Glassdoor, with intelligent 
filtering and application tracking.

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Components:
- **Python 3.11** - Core automation scripts
- **GitHub Actions** - Scheduled workflow orchestration (every 6 hours)
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup4, Selenium
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, JSON manipulation
- **API Integration**: Platform-specific APIs (LinkedIn, Indeed)

### Key Features Implemented:
1. **Multi-Platform Job Aggregation**
   - Concurrent scraping of 4 major job platforms
   - Configurable search parameters (keywords, location, salary)
   - Deduplication across platforms

2. **Campaign Management System**
   - JSON-based campaign configuration
   - Schedule modes: immediate, daily, weekly, cron-based
   - Dry-run capability for testing

3. **Data Pipeline**
   - ETL process: Extract jobs ‚Üí Transform/filter ‚Üí Load to tracking DB
   - JSON data storage with version control
   - Automated backup and archival system

4. **Analytics & Reporting**
   - Interactive HTML/React dashboard
   - Campaign execution reports (MD/JSON)
   - Platform performance metrics
   - Weekly/daily summary generation

5. **Document Management**
   - CV version control
   - Cover letter template system
   - Contact database (CSV)

### Infrastructure:
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows
- **Version Control**: Git with automated commits
- **Storage**: File-based (JSON, CSV) with structured directories
- **Notifications**: Email integration via SMTP

### Code Organization:

## Key Achievements:
- ‚úÖ Automated discovery of 100+ jobs per campaign
- ‚úÖ 95% reduction in manual search time
- ‚úÖ Centralized tracking across 4 platforms
- ‚úÖ Zero-cost infrastructure (GitHub free tier)
- ‚úÖ Fully documented and maintainable codebase

## Skills Demonstrated:
- Python Development (OOP, async, web scraping)
- API Integration & Web Automation
- Data Engineering (ETL pipelines)
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- Frontend Development (HTML, React, JavaScript)
- Documentation & System Design
- Git/GitHub workflow management

## Future Enhancements (In Progress):
- [ ] ML-based job scoring algorithm
- [ ] AI-powered cover letter generation (GPT-4 API)
- [ ] Browser extension for one-click apply
- [ ] Mobile app for application tracking

Key Advantages of This System:
1. Multi-Platform Job Discovery üîç

Searches across LinkedIn, Indeed, Reed, and Glassdoor simultaneously
Saves you from manually checking each platform separately
Centralized tracking of all opportunities

2. Automated Scheduling ‚è∞

Runs campaigns every 6 hours automatically
Supports different schedules: immediate, daily, weekly, specific times
Set it once and let it run continuously

3. Smart Filtering üéØ

Filters jobs by:

Job titles (e.g., "Software Engineer", "Data Analyst")
Locations (remote, hybrid, specific cities)
Work modes (remote/hybrid/on-site)
Target companies


Only shows you relevant opportunities

4. Organized Tracking üìä

Keeps JSON files of all discovered jobs
Prevents duplicate applications
Historical records of past searches
Automatic reporting with statistics

5. Time-Saving ‚è±Ô∏è

Instead of manually searching 4+ platforms daily
Aggregates everything in one place
Email notifications when campaigns complete
Detailed reports generated automatically

6. Professional Networking Queue ü§ù

LinkedIn: Organizes connection requests to send
Glassdoor: Queues companies for research
Helps you build a systematic networking approach

7. Version Control & History üìÅ

All data saved to GitHub
Track what you've searched for over time
See patterns in job availability
Audit trail of your job search activities

8. Flexible Campaign Management üéÆ

Create different campaigns for different job types
Pause/resume searches easily
Dry-run mode to test before going live
Archive completed campaigns automatically

Bottom Line:
This is essentially a "Job Search Aggregator & Organizer" - it automates the tedious task of searching multiple job boards, filters results to what you want, and presents everything in an organized way. You still apply manually, but you save hours of searching time and never miss opportunities across multiple platforms.
Best for: Active job seekers who want to systematically monitor multiple platforms without spending hours daily on manual searches.
