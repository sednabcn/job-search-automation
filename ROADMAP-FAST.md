- Engineered a distributed job aggregation system processing 500+ job 
  postings daily across LinkedIn, Indeed, Reed, and Glassdoor using Python 
  web scraping (BeautifulSoup, Selenium) and REST APIs

- Implemented CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for scheduled execution 
  every 6 hours, reducing manual search time by 95% and eliminating 
  duplicate applications across platforms

- Designed JSON-based data pipeline with ETL processes for job filtering, 
  deduplication, and tracking, maintaining 18-month historical dataset 
  with version control

- Built interactive analytics dashboard (React, HTML/CSS) with real-time 
  campaign metrics, platform performance comparison, and application 
  tracking visualizations

- Developed modular architecture supporting configurable campaign 
  scheduling (immediate, daily, weekly, cron-based) with dry-run testing 
  capability and automated archival system

Technologies: Python 3.11, GitHub Actions, React, BeautifulSoup4, Pandas, 
Git, YAML, JSON, SMTP, Web APIs
